# MyNewsScraper
MyNewsScraper is a web app that lets users view articles scraped from NBC5-DFW and add personal notes/comments to each article.
After scraping just click anywhere on the headline and a note area will appear! You can read the corresponding aticle by clicking the icon preceding each headline, which opens in a new window/tab for convenience.
